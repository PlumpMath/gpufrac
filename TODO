When the window is scaled, the perspective of the fractal should be kept 1:1.

Uniform variables need to either be:
    a) Not set when they aren't used in the shader program
    b) Always referenced in the shader program (drivers will otherwise optimize them out).

Fullscreen mode would be nice.

Mousewheel zooming would be nice.

Flesh out the JuliaCpu generator so that it supports the same settings as JuliaShader.

Optimize the JuliaCpu generator, possibly by hand-assembling the tightest part of the loop, using SSE.

Add support for higher multisampling (4x, 8x, 16x) as well as different multisampling (four rooks, etc).

Oops, the palette mode radio button is out of sync with the generator at app startup...
