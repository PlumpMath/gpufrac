Uniform variables need to either be:
    a) Not set when they aren't used in the shader program
    b) Always referenced in the shader program (drivers will otherwise optimize them out).

Save videos to disk, maybe?

Mousewheel zooming.

Flesh out the JuliaCpu generator so that it supports the same settings as JuliaShader.

Optimize the JuliaCpu generator, possibly by hand-assembling the tightest part of the loop, using SSE.

Would be nice to build the C++ object files in an out-of-source directory.

Consider the possibility of rewriting the Shader, JuliaShader, and Viewport classes in python.
