Give the user a clue about WASD, QE, & the spacebar.

Add mousewheel zooming.

Label the opacity slider.

Make the resolution adjustable during runtime.

Draw the fractal with a 1:1 ratio even when the resolution is not 1:1.

There is a discontinuity for at (x,0) for x<0 when the exponent is a
non integer. I'm not sure why this is. Maybe due to the math. I need to
figure out if it's supposed to be there or not.

Using polar coords is naturally more computationally expoensive. The
