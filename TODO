OpenGL uniform variables need to either be:
    a) Not set when they aren't used in the shader program
    b) Always referenced in the shader program (drivers will otherwise optimize them out).

Save videos to disk, maybe?

Would be nice to build the C++ object files in an out-of-source directory.

Consider the possibility of rewriting the Shader, FractalShader, and Viewport classes in python.

Add a progressive drawing mode, so that when high quality settings are enabled the GUI is still usable.

Add a slider for ambient lighting to the normal-mapping configuration.

Add some controls to rotate the complex plane.
